"""Run: uv run --group dev python -m pytest tests

The caps that became `CHAT_*` knobs in 0.9.0, checked the way test_docs.py checks
`CHAT_MAX_WAIT`: by booting a fresh interpreter through the real import chain rather than
by reading `config` in this process. Two things have to hold and only the second is
obvious — the environment moves the number, *and* an unset environment leaves it exactly
where it was. The second is what makes the change safe to deploy: every instance that sets
nothing must behave identically to the release before it.

Reading `config.MAX_ROOMS` here would prove neither. The value that matters is the one
`store` and `app` ended up bound to, and those re-bind at import — a knob that config
parses but store never picks up is the failure this guards.
