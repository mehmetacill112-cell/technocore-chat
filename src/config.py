"""The CHAT_* knobs — the environment, read once, here.

The environment stays the operator interface: Dockerfile, uvicorn and CI set these
exactly as before. This module is only the binding site — nothing else in src/ reads
os.environ — so each knob's default, floor and normalization live in exactly one place.

Tests need different values without re-importing whole modules, so override(**kwargs)
re-binds these as plain module attributes for the body of a `with` and always
restores them, exception or not. Plain module attributes, deliberately NOT
contextvars.ContextVar: Starlette's TestClient serves the ASGI app in a separate
portal thread, so a ContextVar set in the test thread never reaches a request
handler — a thread-visible module namespace is the whole point.

# of a release. The anti-squat reasoning above (RATE_ROOMS_PER_DAY) is what makes the cap
# survivable and is unchanged: this only decides where the wall is, not who may run at it.

# What ONE namespace may hold. Defaults to MAX_ROOMS and is floored at it, so an instance
# that sets nothing is the release before this, exactly. The floor is the reserved-namespace
# invariant: `topic`, `room-owners`, `room-allow` and `room-nonce` hold one note per room, so
# every room can carry a topic and an owner only while this is at least MAX_ROOMS. A floor
# rather than an equality is the whole change — the invariant needs a minimum, and what sits
# above that minimum is a choice, which is what makes this separable from MAX_ROOMS at all.
#
# It became a knob because a full namespace had no lever of its own. On technocore.chat the
# `did` namespace sat at 10,240 of 10,240 while the whole store was 6.7% full, refusing 3,068
# of 3,417 identity writes in a 15-minute window from 1,585 distinct fingerprints. The only
# lever was CHAT_MAX_ROOMS, which moves three caps to fix one; that deployment doubled it and
# `did` refilled in ~90 minutes. Sharding (`did-<2hex>`, #96) remains the right fix and stays
# what the manual documents — it saw 2 writes out of those 3,417, because the clients with the
# legacy path baked in are not the ones re-reading the manual.
#
# The cost is blast radius, which is why this is a knob and not a new default: one namespace's
# maximum share of MAX_NOTES_TOTAL is 3.1% at the default and 12.5% at 4 * MAX_ROOMS. The
# global cap is untouched and still binds above this, so raising it redistributes the note
# store rather than growing it.
#
# It costs no walk, which was not quite true when the knob landed. 0.9.1 stopped the /rooms
# gauge and the global cap from walking, leaving a create with one scandir of its own
# namespace — read as a fixed price, and it was not: a namespace holds a note and a sidecar
# lock per key, and THIS number is what the directory may grow to, so raising it raised the
# scan by the same factor. 0.9.2 gave each namespace its own count file, so the create path
# reads two numbers and walks nothing, and the cap is a blast-radius choice alone.
